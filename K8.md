# Kubernetes:
  It is container orchestration tool which is used to scale up/down the container based on the load.
  It Open Source Project from Google and supporte on all cloud providers.

## Architecture
 * Master Node
 * Worker Node
 * Compenents
    * API Server - Front End. Users,CLI,Management Device all talk to API Server to intract with Kubernetes Cluster.
    * etcd - Distributed Key value Store. It used to all the information about Master and Cluster and store it all the Nodes on the cluster. It is also used to Implement lock which is used to avoid conflict.
    * kubelet - Agent running on each Node and make sure container are running as excepted.
    * Container Runtime - Software to run containers.
	   	  - Other Container Runtime like rkt and cri-o.
    * Scheduler - It is used to distribute containers across the Nodes.
    * Controller- It is the Brain behind orchestration and responsible for Noticing Node/Containers goes down and make decision to bring up the new container.
    * kubectl - It is used to Manage application to Kubeneters Cluster. Cluster information,Node Status.
 

## Installation	
   * Utility:-
      * minikube - It is used to setup on kubernetes on Single Node Cluster. i.e if we want to run all the components on Single Server.
      * kubeadm - It is used to setup Kubernetes on multi Node Cluster and also used to bootstrap Kubernetes Cluster Installtion.
   * Steps
      * 1)Desiginate Master and Worker Node.
      * 2)Install Container Runtime(Docker) on all nodes.
      * 3)Install kubeadm on all nodes.
      * 4)Initialize Master Node.
      * 5)Verify N/W Connectivity between all the nodes. Need Seperate POD Network.
      * 6)Join the worker Node to Master Node.

## PODS
   * Kubernetes does not deploy container directly on POD.
   * Containers are encapsulated into Kubernetes Object called POD.
   * POD is single instance of the application.
   * We can't deploy same container inside pod but however we can deploy multiple different container in same POD.
    
## kubectl
   *  kubectl run nginx --image nginx ->Create a POD with nginx container.
   *  kubectl get pods  ->To get list of pods
   *  kubectl get pods -o wide ->To get list of pods two additional values like POD Internal IP and Node.
   *  kubectl get nodes ->To view all the nodes that are part of the cluster.
   *  kubectl describe pods ->To View Details of the POD like Namespace,nodes,Image ID,Restart Count.
   *  kubelet cluster-info ->To get information about the cluster.
   *  kubectl create -f test.yaml ->Create POD using Definition File
   *  kubectl pods edit test.yaml ->To edit the config of the existing POD in the yaml file
   *  kubectl apply test.yaml  ->Apply a configuration to a resource by filename or stdin.
   *  kubectl get all -> To list POD,Replica Set, Deployment.
   
      
## YAML

   * 4 Top level Fields
     * apiVersion: v1,app/v1	
     * Kind: POD,Servie,Replica Set,Deployments.
     * metadata: It represent meta data of pods like name and label.
     * spec: It contain information about container like name & image. 
 
  * Tips & Tricks
     * https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9354-kubernetes-and-openshift-resource-support/ ->Download this plugin and import in pycharm to write yaml file with ease.
     * www.yamllint.com ->we can paste any yaml file content in this site to valide the format.

## Replication Controller/Replica Set
   * Replication Controller is heart of the Kubernetes which is used to run reaplica of same POD across the cluster for HA,Load Balancing and Scaling.
   * Yaml Definition File
	1)Version
	2)Kind
	3)MetaData
	4)Spec
	   * template
	   * replicas
	   * selector
	      * Selector is used to specific which POD in the Cluster needs to be part of the replicate.
	      * The Main difference between Replication Controller and Replica Set is Selector field.
   * Commands
    ![ReplicationSetCommands](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30715707/71318525-fff3bc00-24b7-11ea-88af-f31e86aa5edb.PNG)
          * kubectk create -f replicaeset-Definition.yaml
	  * kubectl get replicationcontroller
	  * kubectl get replicaset
	  * kubectl delete replicateset <Replicateset Name>
	  * kubectl replacte -f replicaeset-Definition.yaml
	  * kubectl scale -replicas=6 -f replicaeset-Definition.yaml
  	  * kubectl set image deployment myapp-deployment nginx-container=nginx:1.9.1
	
## Deployment
  * Deployment provides us the ability to upgrade the containter/POD/ReplicaSet on rolling update easily.
 	* kubectl create -f deployment.definition.yaml
 	* kubectl rollout status deployment/myapp-deployment.
	* kubectl rollout history deployment/myapp-deployment.
	* kubectl rollout undo deployment/myapp-deployment.
	* kubectl delete deployment myapp-deployment.
	* kubectl apply -f deployment-definition.yaml --record=true
	Deployment Stragegy
	  Recreate
	  Rolling Update
		  Each POD Creation will create deployment and replication and version also be recorded. We can roll back to the version any time using undo command.
## Networking
 * IP address is always assigned to each POD in Kubernetes.
 * Each Kubernetes Cluster setup will have internal Private POD Network.
 * All Container/PODS can communicate to one another without NAT.
 * All nodes can communicate with all container and vice-versa without NAT.
 
## Services
 * Services is object in Kubernetes which is used to access the Application  that is running inside the container using the Node IP.
 * Service provides the ability to define which port on container maps to which part on the Host.		
     * NodePort: Range 30000 - 32767
     * ClusterIP
     * Load Balancer
     * kubectl get servies
