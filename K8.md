# Kubernetes:
  It is container orchestration tool which is used to scale up/down the container based on the load.
  It Open Source Project from Google and supporte on all cloud providers.

## Architecture
 * Master Node
 * Worker Node
 * Compenents
    * API Server - Front End. Users,CLI,Management Device all talk to API Server to intract with Kubernetes Cluster.
    * etcd - Distributed Key value Store. It used to all the information about Master and Cluster and store it all the Nodes on the cluster. It is also used to Implement lock which is used to avoid conflict.
    * kubelet - Agent running on each Node and make sure container are running as excepted.
    * Container Runtime - Software to run containers.
	   	  - Other Container Runtime like rkt and cri-o.
    * Scheduler - It is used to distribute containers across the Nodes.
    * Controller- It is the Brain behind orchestration and responsible for Noticing Node/Containers goes down and make decision to bring up the new container.
    * kubectl - It is used to Manage application to Kubeneters Cluster. Cluster information,Node Status.
       * kubectl get nodes
       * kubelet cluster-info

## Installation	
   * Utility:-
      * minikube - It is used to setup on kubernetes on Single Node Cluster. i.e if we want to run all the components on Single Server.
      * kubeadm - It is used to setup Kubernetes on multi Node Cluster and also used to bootstrap Kubernetes Cluster Installtion.
   * Steps
      * 1)Desiginate Master and Worker Node.
      * 2)Install Container Runtime(Docker) on all nodes.
      * 3)Install kubeadm on all nodes.
      * 4)Initialize Master Node.
      * 5)Verify N/W Connectivity between all the nodes. Need Seperate POD Network.
      * 6)Join the worker Node to Master Node.

## PODS
   * Kubernetes does not deploy container directly on POD.
   * Containers are encapsulated into Kubernetes Object called POD.
   * POD is single instance of the applicatio.
   * We can't deploy same container inside pod but however we can deploy multiple different container in same POD.
    
## kubectl
   * <kubectl run nginx --image nginx> ->Create a POD with nginx container.
   * <kubectl get pods>  -> To get list of pods
   * <kubectl get pods>  -> To get list of pods two additional values like POD Internal IP and Node.
   * <kubectl get nodes> -> To view all the nodes that are part of the cluster.
   * <kubectl describe pods> -> To View Details of the POD like Namespace,nodes,Image ID,Restart Count.

   * 4 Top level Fields
   * apiVersion: v1,app/v1	
   * Kind: POD,Servie,Replica Set,Deployments.
   * metadata: It represent meta data of pods like name and label.
   * spec: It contain information about container like name & image.
